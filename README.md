# CS-305-Software-Security

Artemis Financial was a fictional financial firm that created financial plans for their customers. They wanted to modernize their software. 

To identify security vulnerabilities, I followed a vulnerability assessment diagram that walked me through the process. It helped me discover problems with input validation and code quality. Code security is important to protect personal information from malicious users, especially in the context of a financial company like Artemis Financial. When code is developed securely, companies can be confident that their applications will function without error, and their customers can have faith that their information is secure.

Identifying some vulnerabilities was difficult at first until I did more research on the different types of vulnerabilities.

I was able to add more layers of security by going through the vulnerability flowchart and making sure as features were incorporated as possible. To assess vulnerabilities in the future, I would use testing tools to thoroughly check the code for problems so I could remove them before they become a problem.

First, I checked the code to see if there were any obvious vulnerabilities. Then, I ran a testing software on the code to check for dependency vulnerabilities. I was able to remove most of the vulnerabilities by updating the dependencies. I suppressed the remaining vulnerabilities that were false positives. Finally, I reran the testing software to ensure there were no remaining vulnerabilities.

In the future, I will study more vulnerability process flow charts and lists and make my own custom list of vulnerabilities to check for. I will also make sure to learn best coding practices and incorporate regular testing as a part of my software development.

From this course, I would show future employers the two projects I made as examples that I understand the importance of understanding the needs of clients, creating a proper mitigation plan, regular testing, and determining the most appropriate methods for securing an application.
